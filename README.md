## About this Project
The goal of this website is to have a place to showcase my previous and current coding proects.

However, the goal of this project lies a little deeper as this site is an example of one of my
projects as well. For most of my career, my learning and focus has been upon backend languages
and frameworks, rarely exploring the frontend side of things.

With my goal to become a Full-Stack Software Engineer, I decided to create this website from scratch
to work on my understanding of Next.js's framework as well as dive into the integration between the
backend and frontend such as custom nginx configurations; this also provided the perfect opportunity
to use Docker, and wow am I glad I finally put the time in to learn it.

Below is my current tech stack being used, as well as other details; feel free to browse and please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions!
